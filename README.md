## Overview

Fall 2023 I decided to learn to properly code in some new languages including front-end dev and css. I am working through the courses on freecodecamp and amd saving my examples so I can use them in future project snipets/frameworks.  I find it much easier to start from my own code later and you may too. These archives are not for cheating on FCC and therefore not linked and vaguely referenced. They are functioning code I have happily made under their guidance and surely I will want to use ut again someday.
